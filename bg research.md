Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?

Mojo lens is an AR contact lens that can provide customers real-time information and images about what they are looking at. According to spectrum.ieee.org Mojo lens has "14K pixels-per-inch microdisplays, wireless radios, image sensors, and motion sensors into contact lenses that fit comfortably in the eyes". 
Ivisible computing is a concept that Mojo Vision came up with which means staying connected with the world and getting useful information without having a device in your hand which is the ultimate goal for Mojo lens.
