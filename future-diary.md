1: I woke up this morning and put my contact lenses on. I walked into the bathroom and did my morning routine. I looked outside, I saw the temperature of the day so I could pick out the approriate outfit. I made myself some breakfast and the lenses showed me how much calories I ate and remind me to drink more water so it's easier to keep track. Then I went for a hike. During the hike, I knew how far I am till summit the entire time, my heart rate, how fast I was going and how much calories that I was burning. 
	At work, I have to meet a lot of people. They're either collegues or new people because I work as a special agent. Whenever I meet someone new, I could see their criminal history or if there is anything important that the government thinks that is worth mentioning. My lenses have the most updated information from the government.
