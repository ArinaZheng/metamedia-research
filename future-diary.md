1: I woke up this morning and put my contact lenses on. I walked into the bathroom and did my morning routine. I looked outside, I saw the temperature of the day so I could pick out the approriate outfit. I made myself some breakfast and the lenses showed me how much calories I ate and remind me to drink more water so it's easier to keep track. Then I went for a hike. During the hike, I knew how far I am till summit the entire time, my heart rate, how fast I was going and how much calories that I was burning. 
	At work, I have to meet a lot of people. They're either collegues or new people because I work as a special agent. Whenever I meet someone new, I could see their criminal history or if there is anything important that the government thinks that is worth mentioning. My lenses have the most updated information from the government so whenever I look at someone, I would have all their personal information listed. This is very useful for my job as I interrogate suspects, I'm also getting some background knowledge of them. Or out in the field, the information helps me to know if their actions are caused by some trigger that we don't know. And they also allow me to see better in low light situations.
    After work, I went shopping. During the drive, I didn't have to look at a GPS device because I can just follow the route that I see on the road. I could also just play and change music without going on my phone which is good since I don't get distracted by other stuff on my phone. As I was picking out where I want to go for dinner, each resturant I looked at, I could see their ratings and specials. 
    By the time I got home, it was quite late already so I just got ready for bed as I'm writing this.
